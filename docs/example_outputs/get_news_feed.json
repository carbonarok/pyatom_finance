                    "story": "<p> The S&P 500 advanced 2.0% on Friday in a resilient session that featured better-than-expected payrolls growth for February. The benchmark index was down as much as 1.0% intraday as investors sold into early strength, but others stepped in to buy the dip and propel the market to session highs by the close.    </p><p>The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6% after being down 2.6% intraday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.9% after being down 0.5% intraday, and the Russell 2000 gained 2.1% after being down 2.9% intraday.</p><p>The February employment report showcased nonfarm payrolls increase by 379,000 (Briefing.com consensus 200,000), which the market viewed as a bullish sign for future economic growth, as the labor market recovery appeared to pick up steam ahead of increased reopening/vaccination efforts. The unemployment rate was 6.2% (Briefing.com consensus 6.3%), versus 6.3% in January.</p><p>The 10-yr yield briefly matched last week's high of 1.61% following the data, before settling unchanged at 1.55%. Interestingly, the rise in yields didn't deter risk sentiment as every sector in the S&P 500 started the session in positive territory. Instead, the negative price action that followed fueled concerns that the recent correction in the heavily-weighted growth stocks wasn't over. </p><p>Nearly every sector turned negative, with the exceptions being energy (+3.9%) and consumer staples (+2.2%). Shares of <strong>Tesla </strong>(<strong>TSLA </strong>597.95, -23.49, -3.8%) were down more than 13.0% at one point. Selling abated around the close of European markets at 11:30 a.m. ET amid a sense that selling had gotten overdone on a short-term basis. </p><p>Energy stocks built on their outperformance, as oil prices ($66.09, +2.26, +3.5%) rallied above $66 per barrel, and every other sector caught the wave of buying interest. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.7%) was the only sector that increased less than 1.0% due to Tesla's decline.  </p><p>Note, while the S&P 500 never went below yesterday's intraday low, the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 did. The S&P 500 managed to close back above its 50-day moving average (3822) after closing below it on Thursday.</p><p>Shares of <strong>Cisco </strong>(<strong>CSCO </strong>46.25, +1.69, +3.8%) and <strong>Oracle </strong>(<strong>ORCL </strong>69.93, +4.32, +6.6%) outperformed following a pair of analyst upgrades. JP Morgan upgraded CSCO to Overweight from Neutral. Barclays upgraded ORCL to Overweight from Equal Weight.  </p><p>The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.15%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.4% to 91.96. </p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><ul><li>The February Employment Situation Report was much better than expected on the payrolls front. The payrolls increase is the highlight of the report and is apt to be the lead headline when it comes to talking about the report; however, there is a soft underbelly to the report that should not go unnoticed. The labor force participation rate was unchanged at 61.4% (down from 63.3% a year ago), the U-6 unemployment rate is still high at 11.1%, and persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 41.5% of the unemployed versus 39.5% in January. The pace of hiring might have picked up in February, yet the travails of the long-term unemployed did as well.<ul><li>The key takeaway from the report is that it will be seen as a sign of even better things to come for the labor market, which bodes well for growth prospects. The increase in nonfarm payrolls was the strongest since October and the best pace for February in more than 20 years, which is encouraging in that it came in front of more states seemingly destined to relax Covid restrictions in coming months as vaccination rates improve.</li></ul></li><li>The January trade deficit widened to -$68.2 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$67.5 billion) from a downwardly revised -$67.0 billion (from -$66.6 billion) in December. The widening in the deficit was a byproduct of exports increasing less than imports.<ul><li>The key takeaway from the report is that trade activity will be imputed as a drag on Q1 GDP growth for now as the real trade deficit in January was 2.4% more than the fourth quarter average.</li></ul></li><li>Consumer credit decreased by $1.3 bln in January after increasing a downwardly revised $8.8 bln (from $9.7 bln) in December.<ul><li>The key takeaway from the report is that revolving credit decreased for the tenth time over the last 11 months dating back to February, which preceded the initial pandemic lockdown period taking hold in the U.S.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Wholesale Inventories for January on Monday.</p><ul><li>Russell 2000 +11.0% YTD</li><li>Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.9% YTD</li><li>S&P 500 +2.3% YTD</li><li>Nasdaq Composite +0.3% YTD</li></ul>",

The S&P 500 went from a 0.5% intraday gain to a 0.7% intraday decline in about 45 minutes. </p><p>Price action stabilized, and the benchmark index wavered around its flat line for the rest of the session. The energy (+1.8%), communication services (+0.6%), and real estate (+0.6%) sectors advanced the most today, while the consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%) underperformed amid profit-taking weakness in <strong>Tesla </strong>(<strong>TSLA </strong>804.82, -44.64, -5.3%). </p><p>In the afternoon, Fed Chair Powell reiterated in a speech that interest rates will remain near zero until the Fed achieves its dual mandate of maximum employment and a 2.0%+ inflation rate over time. Mr. Powell added that the central bank will maintain its $120 billion in asset purchases per month.</p><p>On a related note, total CPI was up 0.3% m/m in January (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%), and Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, was unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). Core CPI decelerated to 1.4% from 1.6% in December. While the CPI data isn't the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, it still signaled muted inflation pressure for consumers. </p><p>The 10-yr Treasury note yield decreased two basis points to 1.13% after trading at 1.17% prior to the data. The 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 0.10%. The U.S. Dollar Index finished little changed at 90.43. WTI crude futures increased  0.6%, or $0.36, to $58.71/bbl. </p><p>Separately,<strong> Coca-Cola </strong>(<strong>KO </strong>49.60, -0.10, -0.2%), <strong>Cisco</strong> (<strong>CSCO </strong>47.24, -1.26, -2.6%), and <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM </strong>54.88, -1.18, -2.1%) closed lower despite beating earnings estimates, while <strong>Twitter </strong>(<strong>TWTR</strong> 67.77, +7.90, +13.2%) and <strong>Lyft </strong>(<strong>LYFT </strong>56.21, +2.57, +4.8%) pleased investors with their results and commentary. </p><p>Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:</p><ul><li>Total CPI for January was up 0.3% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.4%) in December. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, was unchanged (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) after also being revised to unchanged (from 0.1%) in December. On a year-over-year basis, total CPI held steady at 1.4%, yet core CPI decelerated to 1.4% from 1.6% in December.<ul><li>The key takeaway from the report is that it shows all is still mostly quiet on the inflation front as far as the Fed is concerned, which implies to the market that it can continue to count on the Fed not to run interference with its rally effort by raising rates or tapering its bond purchases prematurely.</li></ul></li><li>Wholesale inventories increased 0.3 m/m in December (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) following a revised 0.1% increase in November (from 0.0%). </li><li>The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index decreased 4.1% following an 8.1% increase in the prior week.</li></ul><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report on Thursday. </p><ul><li>Russell 2000 +15.6% YTD</li><li>Nasdaq Composite +8.4% YTD</li><li>S&P 500 +4.1% YTD</li><li>Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD</li></ul>",

However, the report also included a few trouble spots. </p><p>Why is the stock lower despite what looks like generally good results?</p><ul><li> Adjusted EPS and revenue for Q2 (Jan) both exceeded estimates. Maybe we are nitpicking, but the $0.04 EPS upside was a notch lower than the $0.06-0.08 beats Cisco posted in the prior three quarters. </li><li> The guidance for Q3 (Apr) may be weighing on the stock a bit. After guiding nicely higher last quarter, Cisco is guiding EPS in-line this quarter. However, revenue guidance had some modest upside; if Cisco were to hit its target, AprQ would mark a return to yr/yr growth for the first time in several quarters. </li><li>Margins are a closely watched metric with Cisco, and the company performed well here despite a difficult macro environment. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 34.4% vs prior guidance of 32-33%. However, Cisco is guiding to a sequential decline in margins in Q3 at 33-34%, although it is possible that Cisco is guiding conservatively. </li><li>The earnings call was mixed. Cisco said it's seeing signs of gradual improvement led by order growth in Commercial, Public Sector, and Service Provider businesses. However, the Enterprise market remains soft, driven by some elongated sales cycles and a continued pause in spending among some customers in connection with the pandemic. Investors keep hoping to see Enterprise start to turn the corner, but it sounds like it will take time. </li><li>Infrastructure Platforms was down 3%. As a reminder, this is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. That's a notable improvement from down 16% in Q1, but it's still a problem area for Cisco. </li></ul><p>There were some rays of hope. Total product revenue was down 1% yr/yr to $8.6 bln, an improvement from down 13% last quarter. Switching revenue was flat overall, and Cisco saw solid growth in Data Center Switching, including strong growth for the Nexus 9000. Wireless growth was driven by the continued ramp of Wi-Fi 6 products. Webex remains a bright spot, reporting double-digit growth fueled by remote working. Security was up 10%, with cloud security seeing strong double-digit growth. </p><p>In sum, this was really more of a mixed quarter overall. After last quarter's strong results/guidance, this quarter's numbers were not quite as robust. Cisco is cautiously optimistic for IT budget growth in calendar 2021, but the recovery is going to take some time for Cisco. While the company has cloud, security, and video conferencing segments, which are the hot areas for remote working, Cisco remains heavily exposed to large hardware components and enterprise, which have been laggards. </p>",
